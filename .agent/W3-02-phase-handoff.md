# W3-02 phase handoff

## 0a (Lane A) - READY FOR REVIEW

Commit `7a4d06ef` on `task/W3-02-estate-evidence-money-basis` (base main `c50ea24b`). Branch released.

What landed (the spec is Review closure 4, "Shared parser, 3- and 5-part cursor, refusals (B1, S7-S8)"):
- `backend/assetops_backend/estate/scope.py`: `KEYS` gains `evidence` and `financials`, both
  `from,to,known_at,limit,cursor`. `parse_request` and `decode_cursor` refuse an unsupported kind with
  `EstateRefusal("INVALID_CURSOR")` (422). New cursors use the Action key set, with `kind` equal to the root.
  `_marker_ok` validates the 3-part Evidence marker and the 5-part Financials marker (null-first). `cursor_after` is
  kind-aware. New helpers: `cursor_marker(kind, after)`, the wire inverse, and `resume_after(markers, after)`, which
  raises 422 for an absent marker and is called only after the fence.
- `backend/assetops_backend/estate/index.py`: `_fence` returns `cursor_after(cursor)`, so it handles any kind.
  `_cursor(tenant_id, req, scope, token, *after)` keeps the old `(at, row_id)` call sites. `kind` comes from
  `req.kind`. The Finding/Action bytes are unchanged, and a test pins them.
- `backend/tests/test_w302_estate_cursor.py`: 31 tests. They cover parser kinds and the typed unknown-kind refusal,
  both marker arities, null-first money, 20 malformed cases (missing `page_one_mode`, wrong kind, unknown or extra
  keys, arity, non-UUID, empty string, non-canonical instant), kinds not crossing, old bytes unchanged, changed
  grant/selection/window/cutoff and the old `/1` digest giving 409, and historical page two.

Checks: the 6 estate test files on the private DB `w302a_test` gave 66 passed, 0 skipped, in 9m31s. The DB was
dropped afterwards. `tools/check-all.ps1` passed all 11 guards. I ran no full suite, as instructed.

Readings (I am recording these, not making rulings):
1. Evidence/Financials cursors also need the canonical six-digit `from/to/known_at`, matching the "canonical time"
   wording. Finding/Action cursors keep the looser W3-01 check.
2. `site_id` is the marker element at index 1 (Evidence) and index 2 (Financials). It is validated as a UUID string,
   and its case is not normalized.
3. I added `resume_after` to `scope.py` as the shared absent-marker check. Phases 1 and 3 should call it on the full
   ordered marker list, after `_fence`.
4. A changed cutoff is refused 409 inside `_scope` (W3-01 behaviour), before `_fence`.

Next: `0b` (Lane A, W1 day projection), after 0a has its independent review.

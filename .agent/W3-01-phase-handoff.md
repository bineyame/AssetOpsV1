# W3-01 phase handoff (commit 1, Lane B part complete, 2026-10-20)

Branch `task/W3-01-estate-claim-action-roots` (worktree `AssetOpsV1-review2`). Lane B commits: `1c409a3d` (core),
`990f2113` + `2951b66c` (completion, Run 1 rulings 2/4/5/6). **Branch released to Lane A** (ruling 1). No Lane A
call site, migration or Alembic head touched.

## Landed (`backend/assetops_backend/evidence/public_provenance.py`)
- Ruling 2 `*_selection` helpers; `finding_revision`/`consequence_revision` default to the W1 row sets.
- Ruling 4 `PublicProvenance.ev_selected(..., persisted_class)` with `SOURCE_CLASS_MISMATCH`.
- Ruling 5 `dual_blocks(selected, pending)`; ruling 6 `estate_projection`; `LinkRowsReads` for one-connection
  set reads.
- Tests (`backend/tests/test_w301_provenance_dto_postgres.py`): `test_empty_foreign_broken_and_mixed_precedence`,
  `test_persisted_ev_class_disagreement_unknown`, `test_w1_revision_selection_sets_and_estate_projection`,
  `test_pending_dual_blocks`.

## Checks (private `w301b_test`, dropped after)
- Focused file: 4 passed (22.6 s). Mutations after commit, each reverted with `git checkout`: UNKNOWN override
  removed -> FAIL; consequence default selection minus Finding revision -> FAIL; `dual_blocks` alias -> FAIL.
- `tools/check-architecture.ps1` passed. Full suites, workflow guard: not run (out of scope).

## Next
1. **Lane A** (exclusive checkout): compatibility commit per `.agent/W3-01-lane-a-adapter-contract.md`.
   Open q2 items in `.agent/W3-01-pending-rulings.md` (empty-envelope shape; cold pending set) block parts of
   its cold/EV envelope work.
2. **Lane B** after Lane A releases: `test_w1_cold_ev_exact_cited_id_mapping` (ruling 7) against the integrated
   public reads; then review of `1c409a3d..<that commit>`; then W4 cherry-pick per ruling 1.
3. Then W3 commit 2 (estate read/API) per spec.

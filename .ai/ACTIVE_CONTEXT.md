# Active Context

Keep this file compact and current. It is the agent handoff for what matters
now; durable reasoning stays in `.ai/FEATURE_MAP.md`, `.ai/DECISIONS.md`,
`.ai/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `.ai/CODE_STATE.md`, and the task files.

Size rule: this file stays under 200 lines, enforced by
`tools/check-agent-workflow.ps1`. Every agent reads it in full, so it is the one
document whose growth is paid on every task. It was trimmed once for that reason
and grew back to nearly four times the trimmed size in six slices, because
per-slice records accumulated here. They now live in `.ai/CODE_STATE.md`. If a
section here grows by one entry per slice, it is in the wrong file.

## Current Milestone

M1 - A user can configure one mini-grid site, simulate it, and inspect the
resulting operational evidence in the UI.

## Active Task

Two slices in review, stacked, awaiting one browser pass.

T011B, shell and dense content overflow containment, at `3bea36c`. Independent
review: **reject until browser verification is completed**, one High finding and
it is not a code finding - "I did not find a separate structural code finding in
the diff". The Reviewer has no browser either and refused to approve a layout
fix on structure alone. Packet at `.agent/T011B-review-packet.md`.

T011C, Site tab row treatment, at `a804a15`, on top of T011B. A user-review
finding on T011A, raised at the browser: the six labelled tabs read as disabled.
They were not disabled - a destination was `#55617a` and a label `#6b7690`, five
percent apart, so the row said one active and seven greyed out. Treatment fix,
never a state change. Packet at `.agent/T011C-review-packet.md`.

463 frontend tests across 17 files, 304 backend, both guards, typecheck and
build clean on both.

What is outstanding is one browser pass over both, plus the rest of T011A's,
which the user began and which produced T011C. What it has to answer: chrome
stays anchored while only the table scrolls; an empty operator page with the
gate open is no longer taller than the window; the Lab frame is still full
height; and the six aspects now read as not built yet rather than as broken.

T005 to T011, T010A and T011A are complete. T011A carries its User Review
Outcome, which records the finding above and what the user settled.

## Current Site Foundation Sequence

Reworked Site Foundation tasks are T005-T013 in `tasks/`.

- T005: shipped Site Template catalog in Simulator Lab, gated. Complete.
- T006: create a Site from a template; first user-review checkpoint. Complete.
- T007: Site Details by `site_id`. Complete.
- T008: read-only Site Configuration; second user-review checkpoint. Complete.
- T009: shared visual vocabulary. Complete.
- T010A: the fetch seam, split out of T010. Complete.
- T010: Lab template and create surfaces to mockup quality. Complete.
- T011: Sites index to canonical screen one. Complete.
- T011A: Foundation naming and the operator Site tab row. Complete; user
  review deferred to the pass after T011B.
- T011B: shell and dense content overflow containment. In review, rejected
  pending browser evidence.
- T011C: Site tab row treatment, from T011A's user review. In review.
- T012-T013: staged visual fidelity, against the tab row and the name T011A
  settled, and under the viewport commitment.

The second checkpoint is closed. Causal Sequencing step 4, topology, devices,
and the configured single-line diagram, is unblocked for planning and is not
yet planned. No T009-T013 slice may render the diagram, an empty frame for it,
or its signal selector.

## Read For T012

T012 dresses Site Details to canonical screen two. The tab row, the Foundation
name and the overflow rule are all settled before it starts, so what is left is
page composition against content that already exists.

- `tasks/T012-site-details-to-canonical-screen-two.md`
- `.ai/CODE_STATE.md`, the T009, T011, T011A and T011B entries.
- `.ai/FEATURE_MAP.md`, `## Canonical Screen Fidelity`, and within it
  `### Viewport and overflow commitment` and `#### Operator Site tabs`. The
  viewport section is not reachable from the Feature Map Index, so it has to be
  named.
- `.ai/FEATURE_MAP.md`, `#### Guards that follow from this architecture`.
- `.ai/DECISIONS.md` decision-index entries:
  - `D-2026-09-13-shared-site-substrate`
  - `D-2026-09-13-provenance-status-vocabulary`
  - `D-2026-09-13-canonical-fidelity`

## Settled Direction

- M1 ships zero canonical Sites. First run has a genuinely empty Sites index.
- A template is not a Site and never has `site_id`, lifecycle status, location,
  or a place-bound timezone.
- Template browsing and Site creation are Simulator Lab surfaces behind
  `simulator_lab.enabled`.
- Sites index, Site Details, and the Foundation surface are operator surfaces
  and are never gated. T008 built the surface under the working name Site
  Configuration; T011A renames it to Foundation and keeps the old address as a
  redirect. `configuration` stays as the domain word.
- A tab is a destination only when a route behind it renders a truthful surface
  for the identified site. A canonical aspect with no content yet is labelled in
  place, never disabled: disabled says the capability exists and is switched
  off.
- M1 commits to desktop-class width, at least 1280px, and claims no mobile,
  phone or portrait-tablet form. Page-level overflow is not an allowed answer to
  density: shell chrome stays anchored and dense content owns its own scroll.
  Nothing may be dropped to fit - not a Sites index column, not a rail label,
  not one of the eight Site tabs.
- A Site created from the Lab is a normal product Site with
  `source.mode = SIMULATED`; there is no Lab-owned Site store and no publish or
  promote step.
- Operator navigation does not grow for Site Foundation slices.
- Operator Site page and Lab Site page share one presentation substrate at
  `frontend/src/sites/`.
- Source mode, Site lifecycle, configuration origin, evidence readiness, and
  source health are separate concepts.

## What The Code Already Settles

In `.ai/CODE_STATE.md`, one entry per slice, so this file does not carry a
growing record. Read the entries the "Read For" list above names.

- What T006 settled: the Site record shape, the two stores, identity rules, the
  create and index APIs, the substrate modules.
- What T007 settled: the per-Site read path and its refusals, the detail wire
  shape, the operator site routes, the three stated-absence facts.
- Tooling: the per-seam architecture guard, and the settle helper that frontend
  tests must use instead of awaiting a heading or a landmark.

Carried-forward risk lives there too, per slice, with closed items marked
settled in place rather than deleted. Open at the time of writing: no
integration test binds the real frontend clients to the backend (third slice
running, and now a decision rather than a gap); the Site record has no created
or updated timestamp; integration readiness is a stated absence with no field
behind it.

## Standard Checks

- `tools/check-architecture.ps1`
- `tools/check-agent-workflow.ps1`
- Existing backend and frontend tests relevant to the active slice.

## Task Spec Hygiene

Follow `.ai/WORKFLOW.md`, Task Spec Size and Avoiding Spec Chaff. Large early M1
specs are acceptable only when they protect dangerous firsts.

## Inherited M1 Step 3 Exclusions

Tasks T005-T013 inherit these exclusions unless a later reviewed task explicitly
changes them:

- No in-place Site/Foundation editing, Save/Publish over an existing Site,
  rename, duplicate, delete, configuration history, rollback, approval flow, or
  disabled placeholder for those capabilities.
- No user-facing removal flow.
- No Single Line Diagram, empty diagram frame, signal selector, SLD view model,
  topology auto-layout, Devices & Sensors screen, or device-management surface.
- No scenarios, run setup, simulator execution, gateway staging, ingestion,
  source envelopes, evidence records, source health, charts, analytics, Replay,
  or Findings.
- No speculative database, ORM, migration tool, cache, query DSL, pagination,
  or port methods beyond the active slice.
- No operator navigation item, second simulator chokepoint, or weakening of
  previous route, API, navigation, architecture, or fabricated-value guards.
- No mockup value, timestamp, status, label, control, or destination unless the
  active slice supplies truthful backing content.

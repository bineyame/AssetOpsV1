# Active Context

Keep this file compact and current. It is the agent handoff for what matters
now; durable reasoning stays in `.ai/FEATURE_MAP.md`, `.ai/DECISIONS.md`,
`.ai/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `.ai/CODE_STATE.md`, and the task files.

Size rule: this file stays under 200 lines, enforced by
`tools/check-agent-workflow.ps1`. Every agent reads it in full, so it is the one
document whose growth is paid on every task. It was trimmed once for that reason
and grew back to nearly four times the trimmed size in six slices, because
per-slice records accumulated here. They now live in `.ai/CODE_STATE.md`. If a
section here grows by one entry per slice, it is in the wrong file.

## Current Milestone

M1 - A user can configure one mini-grid site, simulate it, and inspect the
resulting operational evidence in the UI.

## Active Task

T011A, Foundation naming and operator Site tab inventory. Built and in review
on `task/T011A-foundation-naming-and-operator-site-tab-inventory`, one commit,
`960a013`. Packet at `.agent/T011A-review-packet.md`.

`USER_REVIEW_REQUIRED: true`, and this one genuinely needs a browser. The slice
renames a surface and adds eight tabs, six of which are labels rather than
destinations, and whether those six read as "not built yet" or as "broken" is a
judgement no test makes.

440 frontend tests pass across 16 files, 304 backend, both guards, typecheck and
build clean. The guard gained four clauses and each was proved to fail before
being kept.

What T011 left open is still open: nobody has rendered the nine-column Sites
index either.

T005 to T011 and T010A are complete, in `tasks/completed/` with their Review
Outcomes.

Next after review: T012, which dresses Site Details against the tab row this
slice settled.

## Current Site Foundation Sequence

Reworked Site Foundation tasks are T005-T013 in `tasks/`.

- T005: shipped Site Template catalog in Simulator Lab, gated. Complete.
- T006: create a Site from a template; first user-review checkpoint. Complete.
- T007: Site Details by `site_id`. Complete.
- T008: read-only Site Configuration; second user-review checkpoint. Complete.
- T009: shared visual vocabulary. Complete.
- T010A: the fetch seam, split out of T010. Complete.
- T010: Lab template and create surfaces to mockup quality. Complete.
- T011: Sites index to canonical screen one. Complete.
- T011A: Foundation naming and the operator Site tab row. In review.
- T012-T013: staged visual fidelity, against the tab row and the name T011A
  settles.

The second checkpoint is closed. Causal Sequencing step 4, topology, devices,
and the configured single-line diagram, is unblocked for planning and is not
yet planned. No T009-T013 slice may render the diagram, an empty frame for it,
or its signal selector.

## Read For T011A

T011A carries the user-visible rename from Site Configuration to Foundation,
the route redirect, and the operator Site tab row from v6.9. It adds no content
and no capability, which is what makes it safe to run before T012 dresses Site
Details.

- `tasks/T011A-foundation-naming-and-operator-site-tab-inventory.md`
- `.ai/CODE_STATE.md`, the T007, T008, T011 and T011A entries, for the Site
  record shape, the read path, the substrate, and what each surface renders
  today. Read the completed task files only if an entry there is not enough.
- `.ai/FEATURE_MAP.md` sections:
  - Feature Map Index
  - Product Spine
  - Enforceable Protected Seams
  - Canonical Screen Fidelity, and within `### Foundational screen architecture
    for the two shells`: `#### Operator Site tabs`, `#### Foundation name and
    subtabs`, `#### Guards that follow from this architecture`, `#### Shared
    substrate consequence`
  - Early Feature: Site Foundation And Configuration-Only Site
- `.ai/DECISIONS.md` decision-index entries:
  - `D-2026-09-13-site-foundation-persistence`
  - `D-2026-09-13-shared-site-substrate`
  - `D-2026-09-13-provenance-status-vocabulary`
  - `D-2026-09-13-canonical-fidelity`
- `.ai/ARCHITECTURE.md` only if dependency direction, contracts, simulator
  boundaries, or protected seams are in play.

## Settled Direction

- M1 ships zero canonical Sites. First run has a genuinely empty Sites index.
- A template is not a Site and never has `site_id`, lifecycle status, location,
  or a place-bound timezone.
- Template browsing and Site creation are Simulator Lab surfaces behind
  `simulator_lab.enabled`.
- Sites index, Site Details, and the Foundation surface are operator surfaces
  and are never gated. T008 built the surface under the working name Site
  Configuration; T011A renames it to Foundation and keeps the old address as a
  redirect. `configuration` stays as the domain word.
- A tab is a destination only when a route behind it renders a truthful surface
  for the identified site. A canonical aspect with no content yet is labelled in
  place, never disabled: disabled says the capability exists and is switched
  off.
- A Site created from the Lab is a normal product Site with
  `source.mode = SIMULATED`; there is no Lab-owned Site store and no publish or
  promote step.
- Operator navigation does not grow for Site Foundation slices.
- Operator Site page and Lab Site page share one presentation substrate at
  `frontend/src/sites/`.
- Source mode, Site lifecycle, configuration origin, evidence readiness, and
  source health are separate concepts.

## What The Code Already Settles

In `.ai/CODE_STATE.md`, one entry per slice, so this file does not carry a
growing record. Read the entries the "Read For" list above names.

- What T006 settled: the Site record shape, the two stores, identity rules, the
  create and index APIs, the substrate modules.
- What T007 settled: the per-Site read path and its refusals, the detail wire
  shape, the operator site routes, the three stated-absence facts.
- Tooling: the per-seam architecture guard, and the settle helper that frontend
  tests must use instead of awaiting a heading or a landmark.

Carried-forward risk lives there too, per slice, with closed items marked
settled in place rather than deleted. Open at the time of writing: no
integration test binds the real frontend clients to the backend (third slice
running, and now a decision rather than a gap); the Site record has no created
or updated timestamp; integration readiness is a stated absence with no field
behind it.

## Standard Checks

- `tools/check-architecture.ps1`
- `tools/check-agent-workflow.ps1`
- Existing backend and frontend tests relevant to the active slice.

## Task Spec Hygiene

Follow `.ai/WORKFLOW.md`, Task Spec Size and Avoiding Spec Chaff. Large early M1
specs are acceptable only when they protect dangerous firsts.

## Inherited M1 Step 3 Exclusions

Tasks T005-T013 inherit these exclusions unless a later reviewed task explicitly
changes them:

- No in-place Site/Foundation editing, Save/Publish over an existing Site,
  rename, duplicate, delete, configuration history, rollback, approval flow, or
  disabled placeholder for those capabilities.
- No user-facing removal flow.
- No Single Line Diagram, empty diagram frame, signal selector, SLD view model,
  topology auto-layout, Devices & Sensors screen, or device-management surface.
- No scenarios, run setup, simulator execution, gateway staging, ingestion,
  source envelopes, evidence records, source health, charts, analytics, Replay,
  or Findings.
- No speculative database, ORM, migration tool, cache, query DSL, pagination,
  or port methods beyond the active slice.
- No operator navigation item, second simulator chokepoint, or weakening of
  previous route, API, navigation, architecture, or fabricated-value guards.
- No mockup value, timestamp, status, label, control, or destination unless the
  active slice supplies truthful backing content.

# Code State

What completed slices already settled in code, and what they left open.

This file exists so `.ai/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md` can stay a routing document. Both
sections below grow by one entry per slice; keeping them in the active context
made it the largest thing every implementer read, and it was the file that had
already been trimmed once for exactly that reason.

Read the entry for the slice you are building on, not the whole file. The
"Read For T00N" list in `.ai/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md` names which entries matter.

Two rules keep this file useful:

- Record what a later slice would otherwise rediscover from the code, and the
  reason behind a shape that looks arbitrary. Not a change log.
- When an open item is closed, mark it settled in place and say which slice
  closed it. Do not delete it: a risk that disappears silently reads as a risk
  nobody ever had.

## What The Code Settles

Naming note for future slices: T008 built the current route and code symbols
under the user-visible name `Site Configuration`. The settled screen
architecture now names that operator surface `Foundation`; this file preserves
the slice record below, while future code state entries should use `Foundation`
for the user-visible surface and mention old code symbols only when they still
exist in code.

### T006 - create a Site from a template

- The Site record is `site_id`, `display_name`, `site_type`, `location`
  (`country`, `locality`), `timezone`, `lifecycle_status`, `origin`,
  `source.mode`, `template` provenance or null, and `foundation` (`version`,
  `valid_from`, `summary`, `components`). `site_type` sits on the Site rather
  than inside `foundation`, because the M1 Site schema names it a Site field
  and two copies would be two sources of truth.
- Two Site stores: `config/sites/` ships empty and read-only, `var/` holds the
  writable user store and is gitignored. One composite adapter merges them and
  refuses a `site_id` present in both.
- `site_id` is charset- and shape-constrained in `sites/identity.py`, above the
  adapter layer, and compared case-insensitively.
- `timezone` is validated by IANA-name shape, not by membership of the tz
  database: `tzdata` is an optional platform package on Windows, and Site
  identity must not depend on which host validated a document. Tightening this
  means taking a dependency, which T006 did not.
- The create API is `POST /api/simulator-lab/sites`; the operator index is
  `GET /api/sites` and is never gated.
- Frontend substrate at `frontend/src/sites/`: `siteReadModel.ts`,
  `siteViewModel.ts`, `siteDirectoryClient.ts`, `SitesIndex.tsx`. Render
  equivalence still ships at causal step 6 with the Lab's Site view.

### T007 - Site Details by `site_id`

- `GET /api/sites/{site_id}` is the ungated operator read path. Lookup
  validates the requested identity in the handler before the port, so a
  malformed id and an unreadable store cannot arrive as the same exception; a
  malformed or unknown id is 404 with a `SITE_NOT_FOUND` refusal, an unreadable
  store is 503 with `SITE_STORE_UNAVAILABLE`. Case-insensitive lookup is
  confirmed as the wanted routing behaviour and the response carries the stored
  canonical `site_id`.
- The detail wire shape is the index shape plus `foundation.version` and
  `foundation.valid_from`. Foundation content, the summary and the components,
  is deliberately not on the wire yet: it is T008's shape and no field for it is
  declared before a screen renders it.
- The Site record still carries no `created_at` or `updated_at`.
  `foundation.valid_from` is the only record-backed timestamp and is rendered
  verbatim as `Valid from`.
- Frontend: `frontend/src/shell/operatorSiteRoutes.ts` owns `SITES_PATH`,
  `SITE_DETAIL_ROUTE_PATH` (`/sites/:siteId`) and `siteDetailHref`. The
  substrate gained `SiteDetailReadModel`, `SiteDetailResult`,
  `SiteDetailClient`, `deriveSiteDetailView` and `SiteDetails.tsx`;
  `SitesIndex` takes a `siteHref` builder so the row link is an address, not a
  mode.
- `SiteDetails` holds the store's answer together with the identity it was
  asked about, and discards it in the render that first sees a new `siteId`,
  before any effect runs. Resetting inside the effect instead commits one frame
  with the previous site under the new address. A per-site surface added later,
  T008's configuration among them, needs the same shape or it will present the
  previous site as the one the address names.
- The three unavailable facts, integration readiness, evidence availability and
  source health, are constants in the view model with a value and a reason, so
  both shells state the same absence the same way.
- The architecture guard gained a Site-detail-component clause on the
  single-definition check (with `*Frame` exempt as the shell route-frame name)
  and a navigation-truthfulness check that `/site-details` appears nowhere in
  `frontend/src` while an identified site route does.

### T008 - read-only Site Configuration

- The Foundation reaches the wire on the existing `GET /api/sites/{site_id}`.
  Site Details and Site Configuration are two presentations of one configured
  Site rather than two resources, so there is no endpoint under a Site and no
  second read model. `foundation` is now exactly `version`, `valid_from`,
  `summary`, `components`, and the API test pins that set exactly so a later
  slice cannot put topology on the wire before a screen renders it.
- A component on the wire is `component_id`, `component_type`, `display_name`,
  `rating`. A component with no declared rating carries `null`, never `0`: no
  rating and a rating of zero are different facts.
- There is still no `valid_to`, and no topology, device, signal-mapping or
  control-assumption field, not even an empty list. An empty list would let a
  screen state that a Site has no devices; what is true is that the M1
  Foundation schema has nowhere to put one. Causal step 4 adds them, and both
  the API test and the substrate state the absence in those terms.
- Frontend: `frontend/src/sites/SiteConfiguration.tsx` and
  `deriveSiteConfigurationView` are the configuration surface, and
  `frontend/src/sites/useSiteRecord.ts` is the one-Site read both site
  surfaces share. The hook carries T007's identity pinning, so the second
  surface could not reproduce that defect.
- `SITE_CONFIGURATION_ROUTE_PATH` is built on `SITE_DETAIL_ROUTE_PATH`, so a
  configuration is addressed under its Site. The guard looks for that shape
  rather than for any configuration route: a path built on the Site's address
  has nowhere to put the identity it would have to drop to become a
  parameterless destination again.
- Operator navigation is `Operator home` and `Sites`. Both parameterless T002
  site frames are gone. The navigation-growth assertion is now stated against
  the T004 list as a baseline, so it catches an item added and removed within
  one slice as well as one added outright.
- The three undeclared facts - devices, signal mappings, control assumptions -
  are constants in the view model beside T007's three unavailable facts, with
  the same value-and-reason shape. The reason in each says the absence is a
  statement about the configuration document and not about the Site. This is
  the wording the second user-review checkpoint is being asked to settle.
- The architecture guard gained a configuration-component clause on the
  single-definition check and a parameterless-`/site-configuration` ban plus an
  identified-route vacuity clause on navigation truthfulness.
- Review fix: integration readiness and source health state what this build
  records, not what the Site has. "No integration is configured for this site"
  and "no source is expected to report" were claims no field backs, and a Site
  with a real integration arrives with exactly the same fields. Source health
  reads `Not recorded` rather than `Not applicable` for the same reason.
  Evidence availability is unchanged: that no evidence has been accepted is a
  fact about this build's own store. Both Site surfaces assert it.
- Review fix: `isSiteDetail` validates the Foundation's content and not only
  its metadata - `summary`, `components` as an array, each component's four
  fields, and a rating that is `null` or `{value, unit}`. A missing `rating`
  key is refused; only an explicit `null` is the document declaring no rating.
  A guard that stops at what one surface reads is a guard the next surface
  renders past, which is what happened here between T007 and T008.
- `frontend/src/sites/__tests__/siteDirectoryClient.test.ts` is the first test
  in the tree to exercise a client against responses rather than a fake: the
  three read outcomes, the request path, and eleven malformed bodies split by
  what each would do if it got through.

### Tooling and test substrate

Not owned by a product slice, but load-bearing for every one of them.

- The architecture guard is a runner, `tools/check-architecture.ps1`, over one
  module per seam in `tools/checks/`. A slice that changes one seam reads that
  seam's module. The runner cross-checks its manifest against the directory, so
  a module cannot be added and left unwired or deleted and left unenforced.
- Screens that read the store render their own level-1 heading and their own
  `<main>` while the read is in flight, so neither is a settle point in a test.
  `frontend/src/test/settled.ts` exposes `settledScreen`, which waits for the
  loading state to go and therefore works for a loaded record, an empty index,
  a not-found refusal, and an unreadable store alike. Settling on a heading or
  a landmark instead is the defect described under T007 open item 5.

## Carried-Forward Risk

Settled before T006: the disabled-bundle concern is explicit in
`.ai/FEATURE_MAP.md` as a runtime reachability seam, not a bundle-content seam.
The gate must prove that no Lab route, action, API, create flow, simulator URL
backdoor, or operator import path into Lab internals is served when
`simulator_lab.enabled=false`; it does not try to prove Lab modules are absent
from the built frontend bundle.

Settled by T006, from T005: the template Foundation carries only `site_type`,
`summary`, and components with declared ratings. T006 copies that as the
Foundation seed, while the created Site record adds user-supplied identity
fields and service-defaulted origin, source mode, lifecycle, and template
provenance. Full carried-forward list is in the T005 Review Outcome.

### From T006

1. `timezone` accepts a syntactically valid but non-existent zone, because
   validation is shape-only. Accepted by the user at the T006 checkpoint, and
   settled again on 2026-09-17: this is acceptable for storage/display, but real
   IANA membership validation must land before scenario timing, run windows,
   replay/evidence windows, scheduling, or analytics consume the value.
2. No automated integration test binds the real frontend fetch clients to the
   backend. Superseded by T007 open item 3, which is the same gap on its third
   slice.
3. Write exclusivity on the user store is process-scoped, not an OS-level
   exclusive rename. Atomicity and durability hold; a cross-process race does
   not. Single-host file store, so not yet reachable.
4. Settled by T007: `get_site` resolves `site_id` case-insensitively, matching
   the conflict rule. T007 confirmed this is the routing behaviour it wants and
   pinned it with API and UI tests; the canonical stored spelling is what is
   returned and rendered.
5. The substrate single-definition guard keys on naming patterns. Render
   equivalence at causal step 6 is the real guard.
6. Product copy uses "capitalisation" in the duplicate-`site_id` refusal. Noted
   at the T006 user review as a consistency question for a later copy pass.

### From T007

1. The M1 Site record has no `created_at` or `updated_at`. The T007 narrative
   listed created and updated timestamps; only `foundation.valid_from` exists,
   so that is what the site page renders, labelled as what it is. Adding the two
   fields is a schema plus write-path change and belongs to a slice that decides
   it deliberately.
2. Integration readiness has no field on the record. The site page states it as
   `Not recorded` with a reason. It stays a stated absence until a slice gives
   it a truthful source.
3. Still no automated integration test binding the real frontend fetch clients
   to the backend. Third slice in a row; covered by a manual dev-proxy smoke
   only. Settled on 2026-09-17: add a focused integration test before the
   shared Site Foundation frontend/backend contract is materially expanded.
4. The site page was verified by tests, the production build, and a real
   backend plus dev-proxy smoke of the API. It was not clicked through in a
   browser.
5. Settled after T007 was built, and worth knowing before trusting a green
   suite: twelve frontend tests settled on a level-1 heading or the `<main>`
   landmark, both of which render during loading, so they asserted against a
   screen that had not loaded. They passed in isolation and failed under CPU
   contention, which is what the T007 packet recorded as an unreproducible
   single failure; the diagnosis there, a `findBy*` timeout, was wrong. Most of
   the twelve assert absence, which a loading screen satisfies trivially. Fixed
   with `settledScreen`; the pattern is the thing to watch for, not the twelve.

### From T008

1. The M1 Foundation carries components and nothing below them, so devices,
   signal mappings and control assumptions are rendered as stated absences. The
   task text asked for them as content. They do not exist to render, and the
   deviation and its reasoning are in `.agent/T008-review-packet.md`; the
   wording of the three absences is on the user-review list.
2. `Not declared` is new product language, written in this slice and not yet
   reviewed by the user. If the checkpoint changes it, it changes in one place:
   the three constants in `siteViewModel.ts`.
3. Integration readiness still has no field. Unchanged from T007, and now
   stated on two surfaces from one constant. Source health was settled again on
   2026-09-17: it must come from backed source/gateway observation,
   heartbeat/arrival evidence, and expected cadence, not from lifecycle or
   simulator provenance. Until then it stays not recorded/not backed.
4. Still no automated integration test binding the real frontend fetch clients
   to the backend. Fourth slice in a row. The configuration surface is the
   second consumer of the same client, so the untested seam now has two callers
   rather than one. Settled on 2026-09-17: add the focused integration test in
   or before the next slice that expands this seam, and do not defer it past
   T011.
5. `createSiteFlow.test.tsx`, the case-variant refusal case, failed once under
   heavy CPU contention on `main` during the T007 closeout and could not be
   reproduced in two further runs, one of them deliberately contended. No
   assertion text was captured. It predates this slice and is untouched by it.
   Worth knowing before trusting a single green run: it is the same shape as
   the defect `settledScreen` was written for, and that test does not use it.

## T009 - Shared visual vocabulary

What this slice settled in code.

`frontend/src/ui/` is the one visual vocabulary and a leaf. It holds
`tokens.css` (type scale, neutrals, rail, accent, four badge tones, spacing,
radius), `primitives.css` (the classes), and seven components: `AppHeader`,
`NavRail`, `Breadcrumbs`, `PageHeader`, `Badge`, `Panel`, and `DataTable` with
`FactList`/`Fact`. Before this slice the app had no stylesheet at all.

The values were read from `Docs/UI Design/Motivation/ScreenMockups.png`, not
invented: dark navy rail with a bright blue active item, white cards on a pale
blue-grey page, pill badges, one blue accent. Visual vocabulary only; no mockup
literal, control, column or rail item came with it.

Names in the primitives are deliberately generic - `DataTable`, `Panel`,
`Badge`, never `SiteTable`, `SitePanel`, `SiteBadge`. The T006 single-definition
guard flags a Site presentation component anywhere outside
`frontend/src/sites/`, so a Site-named primitive would fail it, correctly.

`tools/checks/ui-primitives.ps1` is a new seam with two clauses. Leaf
direction: the primitives import no shell code, no simulator code, no feature
flag and no Site substrate. Shared vocabulary: both the shell root and the
substrate must import the module, because a vocabulary nobody imports has been
forked. Five violations were proven to fail it.

`NavRail` owns no items. Both rails pass their own, so the operator rail and
the Lab rail cannot converge through the component they share. The Lab's items
are declared in `simulatorLabRoutes.tsx`, which is already the only module
allowed to spell a simulator path; `SimulatorLabShell` takes them as props and
names no path, so the gate chokepoint is unchanged.

The Simulator Lab has a rail for the first time, listing `Simulator Lab` and
`Site Templates` - the two destinations that already rendered truthful content.
The mockup's other eight rail items have no route behind them and are absent.

Badge tones are one per vocabulary and never shared: provenance, lifecycle,
origin, neutral. They differ in fill, border weight and corner radius as well
as hue, so the distinction survives greyscale, and every badge renders the word
it means so colour never carries meaning alone. A badge renders only where a
record supplies its value: template provenance stays plain text because a site
created from no template renders an absence there, and every stated absence on
Site Configuration stays plain text for the same reason.

`PageHeader` has no action or badge slot. `+ New Site` restyling is T011's, the
Site identity badge is T012's, and `Edit`/`Version History` are never rendered
at all, so the slots would have been machinery nothing fills.

The brand mark is drawn in CSS rather than as an inline `<svg>`, because
several screens assert no `svg`, `canvas`, `img` or `figure` exists in their
container and that guard is worth more than the glyph. Keep it that way.

What this slice leaves open.

1. Breadcrumbs are provided but adopted by no screen. Adopting them means
   changing settled back-link copy or adding a destination, both of which stage
   1 forbids. They belong to T011-T013 with the screens they describe.
2. Not rendered in a browser. Verified by the suites, the typecheck, the build,
   and by confirming the built stylesheet ships with the expected classes.
   Browser tooling was unavailable in the session.
3. Contrast is reasoned against WCAG AA and documented in `tokens.css`, but no
   contrast checker was run and no automated accessibility assertion exists.
4. Nothing proves a surface renders *with* the vocabulary rather than merely
   importing it. The guard proves the import; the rest is review-time.
5. `SiteConfiguration.tsx` carries a UTF-8 BOM, pre-existing from T008. It is
   invisible to the compiler and the tests and silently defeats line-anchored
   shell commands.

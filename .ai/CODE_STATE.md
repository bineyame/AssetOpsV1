# Code State

What completed slices already settled in code, and what they left open.

This file exists so `.ai/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md` can stay a routing document. Both
sections below grow by one entry per slice; keeping them in the active context
made it the largest thing every implementer read, and it was the file that had
already been trimmed once for exactly that reason.

Read the entry for the slice you are building on, not the whole file. The
"Read For T00N" list in `.ai/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md` names which entries matter.

Two rules keep this file useful:

- Record what a later slice would otherwise rediscover from the code, and the
  reason behind a shape that looks arbitrary. Not a change log.
- When an open item is closed, mark it settled in place and say which slice
  closed it. Do not delete it: a risk that disappears silently reads as a risk
  nobody ever had.

## What The Code Settles

Naming note for future slices: T008 built the current route and code symbols
under the user-visible name `Site Configuration`. The settled screen
architecture now names that operator surface `Foundation`; this file preserves
the slice record below, while future code state entries should use `Foundation`
for the user-visible surface and mention old code symbols only when they still
exist in code.

### T006 - create a Site from a template

- The Site record is `site_id`, `display_name`, `site_type`, `location`
  (`country`, `locality`), `timezone`, `lifecycle_status`, `origin`,
  `source.mode`, `template` provenance or null, and `foundation` (`version`,
  `valid_from`, `summary`, `components`). `site_type` sits on the Site rather
  than inside `foundation`, because the M1 Site schema names it a Site field
  and two copies would be two sources of truth.
- Two Site stores: `config/sites/` ships empty and read-only, `var/` holds the
  writable user store and is gitignored. One composite adapter merges them and
  refuses a `site_id` present in both.
- `site_id` is charset- and shape-constrained in `sites/identity.py`, above the
  adapter layer, and compared case-insensitively.
- `timezone` is validated by IANA-name shape, not by membership of the tz
  database: `tzdata` is an optional platform package on Windows, and Site
  identity must not depend on which host validated a document. Tightening this
  means taking a dependency, which T006 did not.
- The create API is `POST /api/simulator-lab/sites`; the operator index is
  `GET /api/sites` and is never gated.
- Frontend substrate at `frontend/src/sites/`: `siteReadModel.ts`,
  `siteViewModel.ts`, `siteDirectoryClient.ts`, `SitesIndex.tsx`. Render
  equivalence still ships at causal step 6 with the Lab's Site view.

### T007 - Site Details by `site_id`

- `GET /api/sites/{site_id}` is the ungated operator read path. Lookup
  validates the requested identity in the handler before the port, so a
  malformed id and an unreadable store cannot arrive as the same exception; a
  malformed or unknown id is 404 with a `SITE_NOT_FOUND` refusal, an unreadable
  store is 503 with `SITE_STORE_UNAVAILABLE`. Case-insensitive lookup is
  confirmed as the wanted routing behaviour and the response carries the stored
  canonical `site_id`.
- The detail wire shape is the index shape plus `foundation.version` and
  `foundation.valid_from`. Foundation content, the summary and the components,
  is deliberately not on the wire yet: it is T008's shape and no field for it is
  declared before a screen renders it.
- The Site record still carries no `created_at` or `updated_at`.
  `foundation.valid_from` is the only record-backed timestamp and is rendered
  verbatim as `Valid from`.
- Frontend: `frontend/src/shell/operatorSiteRoutes.ts` owns `SITES_PATH`,
  `SITE_DETAIL_ROUTE_PATH` (`/sites/:siteId`) and `siteDetailHref`. The
  substrate gained `SiteDetailReadModel`, `SiteDetailResult`,
  `SiteDetailClient`, `deriveSiteDetailView` and `SiteDetails.tsx`;
  `SitesIndex` takes a `siteHref` builder so the row link is an address, not a
  mode.
- `SiteDetails` holds the store's answer together with the identity it was
  asked about, and discards it in the render that first sees a new `siteId`,
  before any effect runs. Resetting inside the effect instead commits one frame
  with the previous site under the new address. A per-site surface added later,
  T008's configuration among them, needs the same shape or it will present the
  previous site as the one the address names.
- The three unavailable facts, integration readiness, evidence availability and
  source health, are constants in the view model with a value and a reason, so
  both shells state the same absence the same way.
- The architecture guard gained a Site-detail-component clause on the
  single-definition check (with `*Frame` exempt as the shell route-frame name)
  and a navigation-truthfulness check that `/site-details` appears nowhere in
  `frontend/src` while an identified site route does.

### T008 - read-only Site Configuration

- The Foundation reaches the wire on the existing `GET /api/sites/{site_id}`.
  Site Details and Site Configuration are two presentations of one configured
  Site rather than two resources, so there is no endpoint under a Site and no
  second read model. `foundation` is now exactly `version`, `valid_from`,
  `summary`, `components`, and the API test pins that set exactly so a later
  slice cannot put topology on the wire before a screen renders it.
- A component on the wire is `component_id`, `component_type`, `display_name`,
  `rating`. A component with no declared rating carries `null`, never `0`: no
  rating and a rating of zero are different facts.
- There is still no `valid_to`, and no topology, device, signal-mapping or
  control-assumption field, not even an empty list. An empty list would let a
  screen state that a Site has no devices; what is true is that the M1
  Foundation schema has nowhere to put one. Causal step 4 adds them, and both
  the API test and the substrate state the absence in those terms.
- Frontend: `frontend/src/sites/SiteConfiguration.tsx` and
  `deriveSiteConfigurationView` are the configuration surface, and
  `frontend/src/sites/useSiteRecord.ts` is the one-Site read both site
  surfaces share. The hook carries T007's identity pinning, so the second
  surface could not reproduce that defect.
- `SITE_CONFIGURATION_ROUTE_PATH` is built on `SITE_DETAIL_ROUTE_PATH`, so a
  configuration is addressed under its Site. The guard looks for that shape
  rather than for any configuration route: a path built on the Site's address
  has nowhere to put the identity it would have to drop to become a
  parameterless destination again.
- Operator navigation is `Operator home` and `Sites`. Both parameterless T002
  site frames are gone. The navigation-growth assertion is now stated against
  the T004 list as a baseline, so it catches an item added and removed within
  one slice as well as one added outright.
- The three undeclared facts - devices, signal mappings, control assumptions -
  are constants in the view model beside T007's three unavailable facts, with
  the same value-and-reason shape. The reason in each says the absence is a
  statement about the configuration document and not about the Site. This is
  the wording the second user-review checkpoint is being asked to settle.
- The architecture guard gained a configuration-component clause on the
  single-definition check and a parameterless-`/site-configuration` ban plus an
  identified-route vacuity clause on navigation truthfulness.
- Review fix: integration readiness and source health state what this build
  records, not what the Site has. "No integration is configured for this site"
  and "no source is expected to report" were claims no field backs, and a Site
  with a real integration arrives with exactly the same fields. Source health
  reads `Not recorded` rather than `Not applicable` for the same reason.
  Evidence availability is unchanged: that no evidence has been accepted is a
  fact about this build's own store. Both Site surfaces assert it.
- Review fix: `isSiteDetail` validates the Foundation's content and not only
  its metadata - `summary`, `components` as an array, each component's four
  fields, and a rating that is `null` or `{value, unit}`. A missing `rating`
  key is refused; only an explicit `null` is the document declaring no rating.
  A guard that stops at what one surface reads is a guard the next surface
  renders past, which is what happened here between T007 and T008.
- `frontend/src/sites/__tests__/siteDirectoryClient.test.ts` is the first test
  in the tree to exercise a client against responses rather than a fake: the
  three read outcomes, the request path, and eleven malformed bodies split by
  what each would do if it got through.

### Tooling and test substrate

Not owned by a product slice, but load-bearing for every one of them.

- The architecture guard is a runner, `tools/check-architecture.ps1`, over one
  module per seam in `tools/checks/`. A slice that changes one seam reads that
  seam's module. The runner cross-checks its manifest against the directory, so
  a module cannot be added and left unwired or deleted and left unenforced.
- Screens that read the store render their own level-1 heading and their own
  `<main>` while the read is in flight, so neither is a settle point in a test.
  `frontend/src/test/settled.ts` exposes `settledScreen`, which waits for the
  loading state to go and therefore works for a loaded record, an empty index,
  a not-found refusal, and an unreadable store alike. Settling on a heading or
  a landmark instead is the defect described under T007 open item 5.

## Carried-Forward Risk

Settled before T006: the disabled-bundle concern is explicit in
`.ai/FEATURE_MAP.md` as a runtime reachability seam, not a bundle-content seam.
The gate must prove that no Lab route, action, API, create flow, simulator URL
backdoor, or operator import path into Lab internals is served when
`simulator_lab.enabled=false`; it does not try to prove Lab modules are absent
from the built frontend bundle.

Settled by T006, from T005: the template Foundation carries only `site_type`,
`summary`, and components with declared ratings. T006 copies that as the
Foundation seed, while the created Site record adds user-supplied identity
fields and service-defaulted origin, source mode, lifecycle, and template
provenance. Full carried-forward list is in the T005 Review Outcome.

### From T006

1. `timezone` accepts a syntactically valid but non-existent zone, because
   validation is shape-only. Accepted by the user at the T006 checkpoint, and
   settled again on 2026-09-17: this is acceptable for storage/display, but real
   IANA membership validation must land before scenario timing, run windows,
   replay/evidence windows, scheduling, or analytics consume the value.
2. No automated integration test binds the real frontend fetch clients to the
   backend. Superseded by T007 open item 3, which is the same gap on its third
   slice.
3. Write exclusivity on the user store is process-scoped, not an OS-level
   exclusive rename. Atomicity and durability hold; a cross-process race does
   not. Single-host file store, so not yet reachable.
4. Settled by T007: `get_site` resolves `site_id` case-insensitively, matching
   the conflict rule. T007 confirmed this is the routing behaviour it wants and
   pinned it with API and UI tests; the canonical stored spelling is what is
   returned and rendered.
5. The substrate single-definition guard keys on naming patterns. Render
   equivalence at causal step 6 is the real guard.
6. Product copy uses "capitalisation" in the duplicate-`site_id` refusal. Noted
   at the T006 user review as a consistency question for a later copy pass.

### From T007

1. The M1 Site record has no `created_at` or `updated_at`. The T007 narrative
   listed created and updated timestamps; only `foundation.valid_from` exists,
   so that is what the site page renders, labelled as what it is. Adding the two
   fields is a schema plus write-path change and belongs to a slice that decides
   it deliberately.
2. Integration readiness has no field on the record. The site page states it as
   `Not recorded` with a reason. It stays a stated absence until a slice gives
   it a truthful source.
3. Still no automated integration test binding the real frontend fetch clients
   to the backend. Third slice in a row; covered by a manual dev-proxy smoke
   only. Settled on 2026-09-17: add a focused integration test before the
   shared Site Foundation frontend/backend contract is materially expanded.
4. The site page was verified by tests, the production build, and a real
   backend plus dev-proxy smoke of the API. It was not clicked through in a
   browser.
5. Settled after T007 was built, and worth knowing before trusting a green
   suite: twelve frontend tests settled on a level-1 heading or the `<main>`
   landmark, both of which render during loading, so they asserted against a
   screen that had not loaded. They passed in isolation and failed under CPU
   contention, which is what the T007 packet recorded as an unreproducible
   single failure; the diagnosis there, a `findBy*` timeout, was wrong. Most of
   the twelve assert absence, which a loading screen satisfies trivially. Fixed
   with `settledScreen`; the pattern is the thing to watch for, not the twelve.

### From T008

1. The M1 Foundation carries components and nothing below them, so devices,
   signal mappings and control assumptions are rendered as stated absences. The
   task text asked for them as content. They do not exist to render, and the
   deviation and its reasoning are in `.agent/T008-review-packet.md`; the
   wording of the three absences is on the user-review list.
2. `Not declared` is new product language, written in this slice and not yet
   reviewed by the user. If the checkpoint changes it, it changes in one place:
   the three constants in `siteViewModel.ts`.
3. Integration readiness still has no field. Unchanged from T007, and now
   stated on two surfaces from one constant. Source health was settled again on
   2026-09-17: it must come from backed source/gateway observation,
   heartbeat/arrival evidence, and expected cadence, not from lifecycle or
   simulator provenance. Until then it stays not recorded/not backed.
4. Still no automated integration test binding the real frontend fetch clients
   to the backend. Fourth slice in a row. The configuration surface is the
   second consumer of the same client, so the untested seam now has two callers
   rather than one. Settled on 2026-09-17: add the focused integration test in
   or before the next slice that expands this seam, and do not defer it past
   T011.
5. `createSiteFlow.test.tsx`, the case-variant refusal case, failed once under
   heavy CPU contention on `main` during the T007 closeout and could not be
   reproduced in two further runs, one of them deliberately contended. No
   assertion text was captured. It predates this slice and is untouched by it.
   Worth knowing before trusting a single green run: it is the same shape as
   the defect `settledScreen` was written for, and that test does not use it.

## T009 - Shared visual vocabulary

What this slice settled in code.

`frontend/src/ui/` is the one visual vocabulary and a leaf. It holds
`tokens.css` (type scale, neutrals, rail, accent, four badge tones, spacing,
radius), `primitives.css` (the classes), and seven components: `AppHeader`,
`NavRail`, `Breadcrumbs`, `PageHeader`, `Badge`, `Panel`, and `DataTable` with
`FactList`/`Fact`. Before this slice the app had no stylesheet at all.

The values were read from `Docs/UI Design/Motivation/ScreenMockups.png`, not
invented: dark navy rail with a bright blue active item, white cards on a pale
blue-grey page, pill badges, one blue accent. Visual vocabulary only; no mockup
literal, control, column or rail item came with it.

Names in the primitives are deliberately generic - `DataTable`, `Panel`,
`Badge`, never `SiteTable`, `SitePanel`, `SiteBadge`. The T006 single-definition
guard flags a Site presentation component anywhere outside
`frontend/src/sites/`, so a Site-named primitive would fail it, correctly.

`tools/checks/ui-primitives.ps1` is a new seam with two clauses. Leaf
direction: the primitives import no shell code, no simulator code, no feature
flag and no Site substrate. Shared vocabulary: both the shell root and the
substrate must import the module, because a vocabulary nobody imports has been
forked. Five violations were proven to fail it.

`NavRail` owns no items. Both rails pass their own, so the operator rail and
the Lab rail cannot converge through the component they share. The Lab's items
are declared in `simulatorLabRoutes.tsx`, which is already the only module
allowed to spell a simulator path; `SimulatorLabShell` takes them as props and
names no path, so the gate chokepoint is unchanged.

The Simulator Lab has a rail for the first time, listing `Simulator Lab` and
`Site Templates` - the two destinations that already rendered truthful content.
The mockup's other eight rail items have no route behind them and are absent.

Badge tones are one per vocabulary and never shared: provenance, lifecycle,
origin, neutral. They differ in fill, border weight and corner radius as well
as hue, so the distinction survives greyscale, and every badge renders the word
it means so colour never carries meaning alone. A badge renders only where a
record supplies its value: template provenance stays plain text because a site
created from no template renders an absence there, and every stated absence on
Site Configuration stays plain text for the same reason.

`PageHeader` has no action or badge slot. `+ New Site` restyling is T011's, the
Site identity badge is T012's, and `Edit`/`Version History` are never rendered
at all, so the slots would have been machinery nothing fills.

The brand mark is drawn in CSS rather than as an inline `<svg>`, because
several screens assert no `svg`, `canvas`, `img` or `figure` exists in their
container and that guard is worth more than the glyph. Keep it that way.

What this slice leaves open.

1. Breadcrumbs are provided but adopted by no screen. Adopting them means
   changing settled back-link copy or adding a destination, both of which stage
   1 forbids. They belong to T011-T013 with the screens they describe.
2. Not rendered in a browser. Verified by the suites, the typecheck, the build,
   and by confirming the built stylesheet ships with the expected classes.
   Browser tooling was unavailable in the session.
3. Contrast is reasoned against WCAG AA and documented in `tokens.css`, but no
   contrast checker was run and no automated accessibility assertion exists.
4. Nothing proves a surface renders *with* the vocabulary rather than merely
   importing it. The guard proves the import; the rest is review-time.
5. `SiteConfiguration.tsx` carries a UTF-8 BOM, pre-existing from T008. It is
   invisible to the compiler and the tests and silently defeats line-anchored
   shell commands.

## T010A - Site Foundation fetch seam

What this slice settled in code.

The frontend/backend fetch seam is now a checked-in contract rather than an
assumption. `backend/tests/test_fetch_seam_contract.py` drives the real
application through `create_app` across six app configurations and captures
what every endpoint actually returns into
`contract-fixtures/site-foundation-fetch-seam.json`, 24 cases.
`frontend/src/__tests__/fetchSeamContract.test.ts` reads that same file back and
puts the three real clients in front of it, 26 tests.

Neither side imports the other. The fixture is the only crossing, which is what
keeps `tools/checks/dependency-direction.ps1` intact and why the fixture lives
at the repository root rather than inside either project.

The anti-rot rule is the load-bearing part, not the assertions. A normal backend
run fails when the captured responses stop matching what the backend sends, so
a contract change breaks the generator before it can quietly teach the frontend
tests a shape that no longer exists. Regeneration is explicit:
`ASSETOPS_UPDATE_CONTRACT_FIXTURE=1 python -m pytest backend/tests/test_fetch_seam_contract.py`.
A fixture nobody regenerates looks like coverage while proving nothing.

Seven backend guards sit beside the generator so that regenerating cannot
silently erase a distinction: an empty index is not an unreadable store, an
unknown Site is not an unreadable store, every create refusal still carries a
renderable `detail.message`, a closed gate serves no Lab route, a closed gate
does not reach Site reads, a template never acquires Site identity, and no
response carries evidence or simulator-truth fields.

Two facts the seam exposed, both previously unwritten.

1. The backend has two refusal envelope styles. `GET /api/sites/{id}` and all
   four create refusals return `detail: {code, message}`. The Sites list 503 and
   every template error return `detail: "<string>"`. The clients survive it
   because only the create path reads `detail.message` and the others branch on
   status codes, so this is an asymmetry rather than a defect - but it is now
   captured, and changing either style breaks the generator.
2. With the gate closed, an unserved Lab route and a genuinely unknown template
   are indistinguishable to the template detail client: both are 404, both
   become `not_found`. That is acceptable only because a closed gate serves no
   screen that could call it, and it is asserted rather than left implicit.

The fixture is read with `fs.readFileSync` from `process.cwd()`, not imported.
An import would make the bundler resolve a path outside the frontend project,
and `import.meta.url` is not a file URL under Vite's transform.

What this slice leaves open.

1. The seam covers the Site Foundation clients only. Any future client gets no
   coverage until its cases are added to the generator.
2. The fixture pins response shape, not backend behaviour under real stores. It
   is generated over fakes and a temporary store, as every other API test here
   is.
3. Nothing asserts that the app wires its clients with the same base paths the
   fixture records. The frontend test spells `/api/simulator-lab/...` itself,
   because the gate's chokepoint rule forbids importing those constants outside
   the gated module.

## T010 - Lab template and create surfaces to mockup quality

What this slice settled in code.

The Site Templates catalog is a canonical page: a search field, a site-type
filter, and a table whose five columns are the template document's own fields.
The filter's options are derived from the types the shipped catalog actually
contains, never from the site-type enum, and the whole toolbar is absent when
nothing ships. Offering a value nothing matches teaches a catalog the build
does not have, and a test fails if one appears.

The create flow is stepped: `Choose a template`, `Site identity`,
`Review and create`. Three steps because there are three stages of real input.
The review shows what the user supplied and which template it copies and stops
there, because source mode, configuration origin and lifecycle status are
assigned by the backend at creation; rendering them would predict a record that
does not exist, which a test forbids.

Refusals are placed against the field they concern by the backend's own refusal
code, in `REFUSAL_STEPS`. `TEMPLATE_NOT_FOUND` and `SITE_ID_IN_USE` each send
the flow back to the step that owns the field and mark the input with
`aria-invalid` and a described-by message; every other refusal renders where
the user is. Placement is never decided by reading the message text, which
would be a second copy of the identity rules in the UI. `CreateSiteResult`'s
refused branch carries `code` for this, and the code is never rendered.

`+ Add site` is the Lab's entry into the create flow, built by
`simulatorLabRoutes.tsx` beside the operator index's entry point. Two entry
points, one flow, one chokepoint, and no frame spells a simulator path.

The shared vocabulary gained toolbar, form control, step indicator and action
patterns. They live in `frontend/src/ui/` rather than in a Lab frame because
T011's Sites index needs the same search and filter row.

The step number is drawn by a CSS counter, not rendered as text, so the rule
that every digit inside `main` traces to a document or to user input stays
intact. Same trade as T009's brand mark. Keep it that way.

The template inspection view needed no change: T009 had already dressed it, and
its "a template is not a site" statement and absence of actions still pass
untouched.

What this slice leaves open.

1. Still not rendered in a browser. Third slice running, and this one is mostly
   visual: the toolbar, the table layout and the step indicator have not been
   looked at.
2. No client-side validation, deliberately. A user can reach the review step
   with empty fields and be refused by the backend at the end.
3. A refusal that names no field lands on the review step, where the offending
   input is not visible. Placing it better would mean guessing the field from
   the message.
4. Search covers name and template ID, not summary.
5. Filter state does not survive navigation away and back.
6. `SiteTemplatesFrame.tsx` and `CreateSiteFrame.tsx` were destroyed by a
   `git checkout --` used as an undo on uncommitted work during this slice, and
   rebuilt. Behaviour is asserted by the suite, but they are a reconstruction.

## T011 - Sites index to canonical screen one

What this slice settled in code.

The operator Sites index renders nine columns: name with identity, type,
location, mode, lifecycle, configuration origin, template provenance, last
analysed, actions. The set is a named constant in `SitesIndex.tsx` so a test
can assert it whole.

Nine rather than the seven the settled Sites index inventory in
`.ai/FEATURE_MAP.md` lists. That inventory omits configuration origin and
template provenance entirely, while T006's User Review Outcome records the user
accepting them as two of four separate provenance columns, and T011's own
criterion requires both to stay visible. The feature map's authority rule
settles it: where a user review has already redirected a surface, that decision
settles it. The inventory is the thing that should be corrected, not the screen.

Mode and lifecycle are adjacent and separate, each with its own tone. The
canonical mockup's single `Status` column is the error this screen exists to
correct, and a header matching `^status$` or naming both vocabularies now fails
a test.

`Last analysed` renders `NO_ANALYSIS_IN_WINDOW`, which is `--`. That is v6.9's
rendering for a site with no data in the window rather than a placeholder, and
it is a constant so that the day evidence exists there is one place that stops
being true. The column left the banned-evidence-header list; what that ban
protected is asserted directly instead, for every row and against digits and
time vocabulary.

Every filter's options are derived from the records present, never from the M1
schema's permitted values. `ANY` is the no-filter sentinel and cannot collide
with a value a record carries.

The Actions column holds `View` and no overflow menu. The mockup draws one; it
would open onto nothing, because every action it could hold is one M1 has
decided not to have.

`PageHeader` regained the `actions` slot T009 left for this slice, and renders
nothing when it is empty. The create action moved into it: same gated module,
same two flag states, same label the T006 checkpoint settled.

The subtitle is not the mockup's. "All sites (real or simulated)" contains a
word a gate-off build may not say, which three settled assertions check.

What this slice leaves open.

1. Not rendered in a browser since T010, and this is now the densest layout in
   the product. Column overflow, wrapping and the filter row at narrow widths
   are what tests cannot see.
2. Whether nine columns is readable is a product question this slice did not
   answer. The reasoning behind them is truthfulness, not density.
3. Filter state does not survive navigation away and back.
4. Search covers name and site ID, not location or template provenance.
5. No sorting. Canonical screen 1 implies sortable headers; sorting is a real
   capability and the scope limits forbid it, so rows appear in store order.

## T011A - Foundation naming and operator Site tab inventory

What this slice settled in code.

The read-only surface T008 built is called Foundation wherever a user meets it:
page heading, route, and the link into it. `configuration` stays as the domain
word, so `Configuration origin` and `Configuration is fixed at creation` are
unchanged, in wording as well as meaning. The rule is that the screen has a
product name and the document underneath it has a domain name, and they are
different words on purpose.

`SITE_FOUNDATION_ROUTE_PATH` and `siteFoundationHref` in
`frontend/src/shell/operatorSiteRoutes.ts` replace the configuration pair.
`LEGACY_SITE_CONFIGURATION_ROUTE_PATH` is declared beside them with no href
builder, deliberately: no caller should construct that address. It is
registered once, against `LegacySiteConfigurationRedirect`, which renders
`<Navigate replace>` and nothing else. The guard confines the string
`/configuration` to those two modules, so a link, tab or builder that reached
for the old address fails the architecture check rather than a review.

The operator Site tab row is `OPERATOR_SITE_TABS` in
`frontend/src/shell/operatorSiteTabs.tsx`: v6.9's eight, in order, each either
`kind: "destination"` with an href builder or `kind: "labelled_in_place"` with
nothing. Overview and Foundation are the two destinations. The six labels are
plain spans - no link, no button, no `aria-disabled`, no title, and no route
registered, which is asserted by requesting each lowercased path under a site
and getting `Page not available`.

Disabled is the state this row refuses. It says a capability exists and is
switched off; these are not built. That distinction is now enforced in the
guard, not just in review.

The inventory lives in the operator shell. The guard holds three things about
it: declared once, not under `frontend/src/sites/`, and carrying none of the
mockup's Lab run vocabulary (`Configuration`, `Devices`, `Gateway`,
`Ingestion`, `Events`, `Logs`).

The shared substrate gained its first extension slot. `SiteDetails` and
`SiteConfiguration` take `tabs?: ReactNode`, render it under the page header
and above the facts, and render it only in the loaded branch. The substrate
imports nothing from the shell and reads nothing from the slot. This is the
mechanism the feature map names under *Shared substrate consequence*; it exists
because the row's correct position is inside the shared region, and the only
alternative was rendering it above the page heading from the frame.

`.site-tabs` is in the shared vocabulary, with two treatments and no disabled
styling. A destination is a link and the current one carries the accent
underline that `aria-current` already states; a label is quieter so it does not

Internal names under `frontend/src/sites/` still say `SiteConfiguration`,
including the module, the component, `SITE_CONFIGURATION_HEADING_ID` and its
DOM id. Renaming them changes no rendered character and touches every test in
that directory plus both single-definition guard patterns. Every rendered
string and every route constant says Foundation.

T008's `Back to this site` link is gone; the Overview tab is the way back.

What this slice leaves open.

1. Not rendered in a browser. Eight tabs, two styled as links and six as
   quieter labels, is new chrome and whether the two treatments read correctly
   is a product judgement no test makes.
2. The six labels may read as disabled even though they are not. The fix if so
   is a treatment change, never a state change.
3. The row wraps at narrow widths rather than scrolling or collapsing.
4. There is still no breadcrumb anywhere in the product. A truthful Site crumb
   needs the loaded record, not the address, so it belongs where the record is,
   which is T012's dressing of Site Details.
5. The Foundation page has a panel also headed `Foundation`. v6.9 calls that
   content `Definition`, but the Foundation subtab row is T013's.
6. The `tabs` slot is one prop wide. T012 and T013 will want more positions.

What review corrected, and the lesson worth carrying.

Two of the five patterns in the tab row's disabled-affordance guard clause held
a literal `0x08` backspace where `` was meant, so they could never match.
Fixed in `ada4149`. The clause's own non-vacuity proof had passed, because the
single violation introduced tripped a third pattern in the same list and the
failure message names the clause rather than the pattern.

So: a guard clause built from a list of patterns is proved once per pattern,
not once per clause, and the violation used for each must be worded so no
sibling pattern can fire instead. A guard that silently stops matching is
invisible in exactly the way this project relies on guards not being, and this
one was caught by a human reading the file rather than by anything automatic.
Whether that class deserves its own seam - per-pattern fixtures, no control
characters in patterns, failure messages that name which pattern fired - is an
open Architect question the Planner declined to turn into a task.

## T011B - Shell and dense content overflow containment

What this slice settled in code.

Every table renders through `DataTable`, which wraps it in
`.data-table__scroll`, a region that owns the table's horizontal overflow. The
wrapping happens in the primitive rather than at each call site so a screen
cannot render a bare table by forgetting to, and a guard clause holds the other
half: a `<table>` element anywhere outside `frontend/src/ui/DataTable.tsx`
fails the architecture check.

The region is a named focus stop - `tabIndex={0}` plus `role="region"` labelled
by the heading the table already answers to - because a region only a mouse can
scroll hides its far side from a keyboard. Both are conditional on the caller
supplying `labelledBy`: an unnamed `role="region"` is not exposed as a landmark
and an unnamed focus stop announces nothing.

Only `overflow-x` is declared. CSS resolves the other axis to `auto` once one
axis scrolls, but the box has no height constraint, so it grows to its rows and
never produces a vertical scrollbar. Giving that region a height is what would
put rows behind an inner scrollbar.

`.app-shell > .app-frame` sets `min-height: 0`. `.app-frame` keeps its own
`min-height: 100vh` because `SimulatorLabShell` renders that frame standalone,
outside the shell. Two uses of one frame, and the nested one is the exception:
deleting the base rule would take the Lab's full height with it, which is why
the guard asserts both halves separately.

New seam, `tools/checks/shell-overflow.ps1`, registered as the eighth. Five
clauses: the region contains the inline axis; the standalone frame is full
height; the nested frame is not; no shell selector hides page overflow; every
table goes through the primitive. The fourth is the one that matters most -
`overflow-x: hidden` on the document is the tempting wrong fix, because the
scrollbar disappears and the content beyond it becomes unreachable rather than
contained. Hiding is not containing.

Each clause was proved to fail on its own, worded so no sibling clause could
fire instead. That is the T011A lesson applied.

Nothing was dropped to make anything fit, and that is now asserted here rather
than only in the slices that introduced each inventory: nine Sites index
columns, eight Site tabs with no menu, toggle or hidden element, both rail
labels.

What this slice leaves open.

1. Nobody has seen the fix work. jsdom has no layout, so no test here can
   observe a scrollbar; everything asserted is structure and CSS text. This
   needs a browser before it is believed.
2. At exactly 1280px the Sites index table will probably still scroll inside
   its region. The table's floor is roughly 950-1100px and the rail and padding
   take about 250px more. That is the intended behaviour; closing it would mean
   changing density or dropping a column, which the policy forbids.
3. No affordance says more columns exist to the right of the region. That is a
   design addition, not a correction.
4. The tab row wraps rather than scrolling, so it has no overflow owner. A
   wrapping row cannot overflow, and a wrapped tab is visible where a scrolled
   one is not.
5. The unsupported-viewport state the policy permits is not built. It is new
   chrome that makes a claim and should have its own slice.
6. No breakpoint tokens were introduced, so the conditional breakpoint-token
   seam in the guard table remains unshipped.

## T011C - Site tab row treatment

What this slice settled in code.

A destination looks like a link because it is one. `.site-tabs__link` no longer
overrides the colour, so it inherits the accent every other link in the product
uses, and the current tab is told apart by weight and underline rather than by
being the only thing that is not grey.

That override was the defect. T011A styled a destination `--text-secondary` and
a label `--text-muted`, five percent apart, and the user read the whole row as
disabled. Nothing was disabled; the treatment said otherwise, which is a
reminder that the three-state rule is only as true as its rendering.

Two signals now, not one. A divider marks where the destinations end, and a
sentence under the row says how many aspects have no content in this build yet,
so the distinction holds in greyscale and for a reader who does not know that
grey means unbuilt here.

The sentence counts rather than names. The first version listed all six under a
row that had just shown all six, and the user's browser pass called it heavier
than the row it was explaining. It reads "Six aspects of a Site have no content
in this build yet." - `of a Site`, not `of this Site`, because no aspect is
missing content because of anything about the site on screen, and the shorter
phrasing must not become a claim about that particular site.

`labelledAspectsSentence` derives that sentence from the tab inventory and is
exported with the inventory as a parameter, so tests can hand it arrangements
this product does not have yet. An aspect promoted to a destination leaves the
sentence in the same change that moves it. A written-out list would have gone
stale the first time an aspect got content, and the screen would then have said
something has no content while the tab beside it opened that content. It
returns null when nothing is labelled, so the day every aspect has content the
sentence disappears rather than becoming an empty claim.

The sentence states what this build contains and never what a later one will.
`coming soon` and its family stay banned, and the guard enforces it inside this
module - it caught a code comment that explained the ban by quoting the banned
phrase, which is incidental evidence that the `ada4149` repair holds.

The baseline rule moved from `.site-tabs` to `.site-tabs__list`. The sentence
lives inside the same landmark, and a border on the nav would have drawn itself
under the sentence, leaving the active tab's negative-margin underline against
nothing.

What the user confirmed, and what is still unseen.

This row was seen. The user rendered it, reported the six read as disabled,
chose the treatment, rendered the result, and confirmed the row reads correctly
with only the sentence to shorten. That is the whole reason this slice exists,
and it is settled. What remains unseen belongs to T011B, not here: whether
chrome stays anchored while a table scrolls, and whether an empty operator page
with the gate open still runs past the viewport.

What this slice leaves open.

1. The correction may overshoot: two accent destinations could make the row
   read as all links. Not raised by the user, and not something a test sees.
2. The divider is a border rather than an element, so the grouping is visual
   only and the sentence is the whole non-visual channel.
3. The sentence sits inside the nav, so a reader skipping navigation skips the
   explanation with it.
4. Colour and divider have no guard clause. Consistent with the viewport
   policy, which leaves exact visual fit to review, but it means a future slice
   could regrey the row without anything failing except a human looking.

## T012 - Site Details to canonical screen two

What this slice settled in code.

The Site page is titled by `site_id`, with the display name beneath it and the
mode badge beside it. What addresses a site titles its page; a name is a label
on the thing rather than the thing. The id rendered is the record's, so a
case-variant address still resolves to one spelling on screen.

Breadcrumbs exist for the first time. The shell names the parent, because where
a surface sits in a route hierarchy is a shell's fact about its own routes, and
the substrate appends the Site from the loaded record. That split is what T011A
could not do: a crumb built from the address would have rendered `mg-002` on a
page showing `MG-002`. `Back to Sites` is gone, superseded by the crumb.

`PageHeader` gained the `badge` slot T009 deferred to this slice.

Quick actions is where the three-state rule becomes markup, and it carries two
different rules at once.

- The gate rule is about existence. `Open in Simulator Lab` and `Start
  Simulation` come from `simulatorLabSiteActions` in the one gated module,
  which returns an empty list when the flag is off, so a gate-off build renders
  no control, no label and no hint that a developer workspace exists.
- The sequencing rule is about eligibility. With the flag on those two render
  disabled, naming the causal step that would make them work.
- `View Live Data` obeys only the second rule. It is not a simulator
  capability, so it is the substrate's, renders in both gate states, and is
  unavailable for an evidence reason rather than a Lab reason.

Getting either rule backwards looks like a detail and is not: a gated control
rendered disabled leaks the existence of a developer workspace into a build
that has none, and a sequenced control that disappears hides a capability the
product intends to have.

Every disabled control carries its prerequisite as visible text tied by
`aria-describedby`, never a tooltip: a disabled button takes no focus, so a
tooltip on one is a reason a keyboard cannot reach. Everything M1 decided
against stays absent from the DOM, because disabled would read as soon.

The substrate gained its second and third slots, `parentCrumb` and
`quickActions`. It still imports no shell code, no simulator code and no
feature flag, and carries no discriminant. With the slots empty - the shape a
substrate test renders and the shape a gate-off build produces - the panel is
still correct rather than an empty frame.

Four inherited assertions moved and none was loosened. "No control renders"
became "no enabled control renders", which also requires every control to be a
button. "Identical markup in both gate states" became identical Site facts,
comparing everything but the Quick actions panel, with a stripper that throws
when it finds no panel so it cannot pass by deleting both sides. "Names and
reaches no simulator surface" split into an absolute reachability claim in both
states and a naming claim scoped to gate-off, plus a new positive assertion for
gate-on. The heading assertions followed the title to `site_id` and gained the
display name beneath it.

What this slice leaves open.

1. Not rendered in a browser. Three disabled buttons each with a paragraph of
   reason may be the heaviest region on the screen.
2. A disabled button takes no focus, so a keyboard user tabs past all three
   actions. The reasons are visible text and are read in document order, but
   they are not reachable by tabbing to the control they describe.
3. The mode badge appears twice, in the identity header and in the provenance
   panel. Both are true; a reader may wonder whether they are one fact.
4. The prerequisite strings are authored prose about the product's own
   sequencing, not derived facts. They will need revisiting as those steps land.
5. The Site information panel keeps the heading id
   `site-detail-identity-heading` while its heading text changed.
6. `site_id` as the page title is a visible change to a screen the user has
   already seen titled by the display name.

What review corrected in T012.

The `Site information` panel did not carry the facts the task assigns to it:
Lifecycle sat with provenance, and the foundation's version and validity had a
panel of their own. They moved. Mode, configuration origin and template
provenance stayed, because those describe where evidence and documents come
from rather than the site itself.

The reason it went unnoticed is the part worth keeping. Every fact was asserted
with a helper that searched the whole container, so a fact could be anywhere on
the page and still satisfy a criterion that names a panel. Panel membership was
never tested, only presence. The assertions now scope by heading id and throw
when there is no panel to scope to.

Proving that took two attempts and the first was wrong. Deleting a fact fails
plenty of assertions and proves nothing about membership; the scenario the
finding describes is a fact still on the page in the wrong place. Moving
lifecycle back to provenance leaves every global assertion green and fails only
the two scoped ones, which is the proof that was needed.

Rearranging panels put a settled seam at risk: the mockup collapses lifecycle
and mode into one `Status`, and T007 placed them adjacent so a reader could see
they were not. Adjacency was never what carried it - separate terms, values and
tones are - so the separation survived the move, and the doc comment claiming
they are adjacent rows was corrected rather than left to go stale.
